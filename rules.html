            <p>This glossary includes game terms that have new or revised meaning in these playtest rules, as well as terms, such as <a href="#co_creature_type">Creature Type</a>,that aren&#39;t defined in the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>.The terms are organized alphabetically.</p>
            <p>If a term doesn&#39;t appear here, use its definition in the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>, and when playtesting this document, do not use the rules glossary of any other <i>Unearthed Arcana</i> article.</p>

            <h3 id="co_arcane_spells"><span>Arcane Spells</span></h3>
            <p>An <a href="">Arcane Spell</a> draws on the ambient magic of the multiverse. <a href="">Bards</a>, <a href="">Sorcerers</a>, <a href="">Warlocks</a>, and <a href="">Wizards</a> harness this magic, as do <a href="">Artificers</a>.</p>

            <h3 id="co_artisans_tools"><span>Artisan&#39;s Tools</span></h3>
            <p>Artisan&#39;s Tools are a category of tool with which a character can gain <a href="#co_tool_proficiency">Tool Proficiency</a>. For a list of Artisan&#39;s Tools, see the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>, but ignore the prices there; those tools now cost 15 <abbr title="gold pieces">GP</abbr> apiece.</p>

            <h3 id="co_creature_type"><span>Creature Type</span></h3>
            <p>Every creature in <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&#38;D</abbr>, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type.<br>Here&#39;s a list of the game&#39;s Creature Types in alphabetical order:</p>
            <table class="t1">
               <caption>Creature Types</caption>
               <tr>
                  <td>Aberration</td>
                  <td>Beast</td>
                  <td>Celestial</td>
                  <td>Construct</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Dragon</td>
                  <td>Elemental</td>
                  <td>Fey</td>
                  <td>Fiend</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Giant</td>
                  <td>Humanoid</td>
                  <td>Monstrosity</td>
                  <td>Ooze</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td>Plant</td>
                  <td>Undead</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td></td>
               </tr>
            </table>
            <p>These types don&#39;t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the description of <a href=""><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> specifies that the Spell doesn&#39;t benefit a Construct.</p>

            <h3 id="co_d20_test"><span>D20 Test</span></h3>
            <p>The term d20 Test encompasses the three main d20 rolls of the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. If something in the game affects d20 Tests, it affects all three of those rolls.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> determines whether a d20 Test is warranted in any given circumstance.To be warranted, a d20 Test must have a target number no less than 5 and no greater than 30.</p>
            <h4>Rolling a 1</h4>
            <p>If you roll a 1 on the d20, the d20 Test automatically fails, regardless of any modifiers to the roll.</p>
            <h4>Rolling a 20</h4>
            <p>If you roll a 20 on the d20, the d20 Test automatically succeeds, regardless of any modifiers to the roll. A player character also gains <a href="#co_inspiration">Inspiration</a> when rolling the 20, thanks to the remarkable success.</p>
            <p>Rolling a 20 doesn&#39;t bypass limitations on the test, such as range and line of sight. The 20 bypasses only bonuses and penalties to the roll.</p>
            <h3>Critical Hits</h3>
            <p>Weapons and <a href="#co_unarmed_strike">Unarmed Strikes</a> have a special feature for player characters: Critical Hits. If a player character rolls a 20 for an attack roll with a Weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the attack is also a Critical Hit, which means it deals extra damage to the target; you roll the damage dice of the Weapon or Unarmed Strike a second time and add the second roll as extra damage to the target. For example, a Mace deals Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you score a Critical Hit with the Mace, it instead deals 2d6 + your Strength modifier.</p>
            <p>If your Weapon or Unarmed Strike has no damage dice, it deals no extra damage on a Critical Hit.</p>

            <h3 id="co_divine_spells"><span>Divine Spells</span></h3>
            <p>A <a href="">Divine Spell</a> draws on the power of gods and the Outer Planes. Clerics and Paladins harness this magic.</p>

            <h3 id="co_gaming_set"><span>Gaming Set</span></h3>
            <p>Gaming Sets are a category of tool with which a character can gain Tool Proficiency. For a list of Gaming Sets, see the 2014 <i>Player&#39s;s Handbook</i>, but ignore the prices there; those sets now cost 1 <abbr title="gold piece">GP</abbr> apiece.</p>

            <h3 id="co_grappled"><span>Grappled [Condition]</span></h3>
            <p>While you are Grappled, you experience the following effects:</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Speed 0.</b> Your speed is 0 and can&#39;t change.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Attacks Affected.</b> You have Disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Movable.</b> The grappler can drag or carry you, but the grappler suffers the <a href="#co_slowed">Slowed Condition</a> while moving, unless you are Tiny or two or more Sizes smaller than the grappler.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Escape.</b> While Grappled, you can make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw against the grapple&#39;s escape <abbr title="Difficulty Class">DC</abbr> at the end of each of your turns, ending the Condition on yourself on a success. The Condition also ends if the grappler is <a href="#co_incapacitated">Incapacitated</a> or if something moves you outside the grapple&#39;s range without using your Speed.</p>

            <h3 id="co_incapacitated"><span>Incapacitated [Condition]</span></h3>
            <p>While you are Incapacitated, you experience the following effects:</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Inactive.</b> You can&#39;t take Actions or Reactions.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; No Concentration.</b> Your Concentration is broken.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Speechless.</b>You can&#39;t speak.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Surprised.</b> If you are Incapacitated when you roll Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.</p>

            <h3 id="co_inspiration"><span>Inspiration</span></h3>
            <p>When you have Inspiration, you can expend it to give yourself Advantage on a d20 Test. You must decide to do so before rolling the die.</p>
            <h4>Gaining Inspiration</h4>
            <p>The main way a character gains Inspiration is by rolling a 20 for a d20 Test. The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> can also award Inspiration to a character who&#39;s done something that is particularly heroic or amusing.</p>
            <h4>Only One at a Time</h4>
            <p>You can never have more than one instance of Inspiration. If something gives you Inspiration and you already have it, you can give Inspiration to a player character in your group who lacks it.</p>
            <h4>Losing Inspiration</h4>
            <p>If you still have Inspiration when you start a <a href="#co_long_rest">Long Rest</a>, you lose that Inspiration.</p>

            <h3 id="co_long_rest"><span>Long Rest</span></h3>
            <p>A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours long—during which a creature sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
            </p>
            <h4>Benefits of the Rest</h4>
            <p>At the end of a Long Rest, a creature regains all lost Hit Points. The creature also regains spent Hit Dice, up to half of the creature&#39;s total number of them (round down; minimum of one die).</p>
            <p>A creature can&#39;t benefit from more than one Long Rest in a 24-hour period, and a creature must have at least 1 Hit Point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
            <h4>Interrupting the Rest</h4>
            <p>If a Long Rest is interrupted by combat or by 1 hour of walking, casting Spells, or similar activity, the rest confers no benefit and must be restarted; however, if the rest was at least 1 hour long before the interruption, the creature gains the benefits of a Short Rest.</p>

            <h3 id="co_musical_instrument"><span>Musical Instrument</span></h3>
            <p>Musical Instruments are a category of tool with which a character can gain <a href="#co_tool_proficiency">Tool Proficiency</a>. For a list of Musical Instruments, see the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>, but ignore the prices there; those instruments now cost 20 <abbr title="gold pieces">GP</abbr> apiece.</p>

            <h3 id="co_primal_spells"><span>Primal Spells</span></h3>
            <p>A <a href="">Primal Spell</a> draws on the forces of nature and the Inner Planes. Druids and Rangers harness this magic. </p>

            <h3 id="co_slowed"><span>Slowed [Condition]</span></h3>
            <p>Whileyou are Slowed, you experience the following effects:</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Limited Movement.</b> You must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot you move using your Speed.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Attacks Affected.</b> Attack rolls against you have Advantage.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Dexterity Saves Affected.</b> You have Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p>

            <h3 id="co_tool_proficiency"><span>Tool Proficiency</span></h3>
            <p>If you have Proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses that tool. If you have Proficiency in the Skill that&#39;s also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This functionality means you can benefit from both Skill Proficiency and Tool Proficiency on the same ability check.</p>

            <h3 id="co_tremorsense"><span>Tremorsense</span></h3>
            <p>A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it&#39;s detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.</p>
            <p>Tremorsense can&#39;t detect creatures or objects in the air, and Tremorsense doesn&#39;t count as a form of sight.</p>

            <h3 id="co_unarmed_strike"><span>Unarmed Strike</span></h3>
            <p>An Unarmed Strike is a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within your Reach.</p>
            <p>Your bonus to hit with an Unarmed Strike equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, your Unarmed Strike causes one of the following effects of your choice:</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Damage.</b> The target takes Bludgeoning Damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Grapple.</b> The target is <a href="#co_grappled">Grappled</a>, and the grapple&#39;s escape DC equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab the target.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Shove.</b> You either push the target 5 feet away or knock the target Prone. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you.</p>

            <p>This glossary includes game terms that have new or revised meaning in these playtest rules, as well as terms, such as <a href="#ec_creature_type">Creature Type</a>,that aren&#39;t defined in the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>.The terms are organized alphabetically.</p>
            <p>If a term doesn&#39;t appear here, use its definition in the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>, and when playtesting this document, do not use the rules glossary of any other <i>Unearthed Arcana</i> article.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_ability_check"><span>Ability Check</span></h3>
            <p>The Ability Check is one of three types of <a href="#ec_d20_test">d20 Tests</a>. The rules often call for an Ability Check, and the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> can also call for an Ability Check, determining which ability to use when a creature attempts something (other than an Attack Roll or a Saving Throw) that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the results.</p>
            <p>The Ability Check has the following special rules:</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <p>When you make an Ability Check, the rules or the <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> determines whether a Skill Proficiency is relevant to the check. If you have a relevant Skill Proficiency, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the roll. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength Check (Acrobatics or Athletics), you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have Acrobatics or Athletics Proficiency.</p>
            <h4>Action Required</h4>
            <p>Making an Ability Check requires you to take an Action unless a rule says otherwise. Several of the named Actions—such as <a href="#ec_hide">Hide</a> and <a href="#ec_influence">Influence</a>—include Ability Checks.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master"></abbr> may override this requirement and allow a particular Ability Check to be made as part of a Bonus Action or as no Action at all.</p>
            <h4>Difficulty Class</h4>
            <p>The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> determines the Difficulty Class of an Ability Check and can override a DC specified in the rules. The Typical Difficulty Class table shows the most common DCs.</p>
            <p>The default DC for a check is 15, and it is rarely worth calling for an Ability Check if the DC is as low as 5, unless the potential failure is narratively interesting.</p>
            <table class="t1">

            <h4>Moving Between Attacks</h4>
            <p>If you <a href="#ec_move">Move</a> on your turn, you can use some or all of that movement to move between the attacks of this Action if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack Action.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_attack_roll"><span>Attack Roll</span></h3>
            <p>The Attack Roll is one of three types of <a href="#ec_d20_test">d20 Tests</a>. This <i>Unearthed Arcana</i> article uses the rules for attack rolls and critical hits found in the 2014 <i>Player&#39;s Handbook</i>.</p>

Moreover, you can effectively see a <a href="#ec_hidden">Hidden</a> or an <a href="#ec_invisible">Invisible</a> creature in that range.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_climb_speed">Climb Speed</h3>
            <p>A Climb Speed can be used to move on a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. A Climb Speed can also be used in any situation in which your Speed is usable.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_creature_type"><span>Creature Type</span></h3>
            <p>Every creature in <abbr title="Dungeons & Dragons">D&#38;D</abbr>, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are.

               </tr>
            </table>
            <p>These types don&#39;t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the description of <a href=""><i>Cure Wounds</i></a> specifies that the Spell doesn&#39;t benefit a Construct.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_d20_test"><span>D20 Test</span></h3>
            <p>The term d20 Test encompasses the three main d20 rolls of the game: <a href="#ec_ability_check">Ability Checks</a>, <a href="#ec_attack_roll">Attack Rolls</a>, and Saving Throws. If something in the game affects d20 Tests, it affects all three of those rolls.</p>
            <p>Whenever a player character rolls a 1 for a d20 Test, that character gains <a href="#ec_heroic_inspiration">Heroic Inspiration</a>.</p>
            <p>The DM determines whether a d20 Test is warranted in any given circumstance.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_dash"><span>Dash [Action]</span></h3>

            <p>If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn&#39;t cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn&#39;t.</p>
            <p>A space is Difficult Terrain for a creature if the space contains any of the following:</p>
            <ul class="ind">
               <li>Creature that isn&#39;t Tiny</li>
               <li>Furniture that is Small or larger</li>

            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Levels of Exhaustion.</b> This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds10.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; d20 Rolls Affected.</b> When you make a <a href="#ec_d20_test">d20 Test</a>, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Spell Save <abbr title="Difficulty Classes">DCs</abbr> Affected.</b> Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spellsave DC of any Spell you cast.</p>

            <h3 id="ec_expertise"><span>Expertise</span></h3>
            <p>Expertise is a special feature that enhances your use of a particular Skill Proficiency. If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one Skill in which you have Proficiency. You can never have Expertise in the same Skill Proficiency more than once.</p>

            <h3 id="co_inspiration"><span>Inspiration</span></h3>
            <p>When you have Inspiration, you can expend it to give yourself Advantage on a d20 Test. You must decide to do so before rolling the die.</p>
            <h4>Gaining Inspiration</h4>
            <p>The main way a character gains Inspiration is by rolling a 20 for a d20 Test. The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> can also award Inspiration to a character who&#39;s done something that is particularly heroic or amusing.</p>
            <h4>Only One at a Time</h4>
            <p>You can never have more than one instance of Inspiration. If something gives you Inspiration and you already have it, you can give Inspiration to a player character in your group who lacks it.</p>
            <h4>Losing Inspiration</h4>
            <p>If you still have Inspiration when you start a <a href="#co_long_rest">Long Rest</a>, you lose that Inspiration.</p>

            <h3 id="co_long_rest"><span>Long Rest</span></h3>
            <p>A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours long—during which a creature sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
            </p>
            <h4>Benefits of the Rest</h4>
            <p>At the end of a Long Rest, a creature regains all lost Hit Points. The creature also regains spent Hit Dice, up to half of the creature&#39;s total number of them (round down; minimum of one die).</p>
            <p>A creature can&#39;t benefit from more than one Long Rest in a 24-hour period, and a creature must have at least 1 Hit Point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>
            <h4>Interrupting the Rest</h4>
            <p>If a Long Rest is interrupted by combat or by 1 hour of walking, casting Spells, or similar activity, the rest confers no benefit and must be restarted; however, if the rest was at least 1 hour long before the interruption, the creature gains the benefits of a Short Rest.</p>

            <h3 id="co_musical_instrument"><span>Musical Instrument</span></h3>
            <p>Musical Instruments are a category of tool with which a character can gain <a href="#co_tool_proficiency">Tool Proficiency</a>.

            <p>Whileyou are Slowed, you experience the following effects:</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Limited Movement.</b> You must spend 1 extra foot of movement for every foot you move using your Speed.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Attacks Affected.</b> Attack rolls against you have Advantage.</p>
            <p class="ind"><b>&bull; Dexterity Saves Affected.</b> You have Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p>

            <h3 id="co_tool_proficiency"><span>Tool Proficiency</span></h3>
            <p>If you have Proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses that tool. If you have Proficiency in the Skill that&#39;s also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This functionality means you can benefit from both Skill Proficiency and Tool Proficiency on the same ability check.</p>

            <h3 id="co_tremorsense"><span>Tremorsense</span></h3>
            <p>A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it&#39;s detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.</p>
            <p>Tremorsense can&#39;t detect creatures or objects in the air, and Tremorsense doesn&#39;t count as a form of sight.</p>

            <h3 id="co_unarmed_strike"><span>Unarmed Strike</span></h3>
            <p>An Unarmed Strike is a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within your Reach.</p>
